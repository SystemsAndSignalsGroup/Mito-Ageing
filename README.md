# Mito-Ageing
Bioinformatics pipeline for obtaining heteroplasmy features from scRNA-seq raw data. The pipeline goes from raw .fastq files and outputs standard features of a single cell workflow including aligned .bam files and expression matrices. As well as this, the heteroplasmy of mutations observed in single cells is output as a csv file which is then used for further analysis.
