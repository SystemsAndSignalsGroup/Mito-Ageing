We provide example scripts for different steps in our analysis pipeline.

1. Processing of raw sequencing reads
2. Characterisation of mitochondrial mutations at a single-cell level
3. Figure creating for SFS
4. Gene-expression analysis

For steps (3) and (4) we provide precomputed data such that figures from our manuscript can be reproduced.
