We provide Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how the gene expression data can be combined with mtDNA mutation data to obtain differentially expressed genes.

See `increasingMitoLoadWithAge.ipynb` for how to
1. Combine Gene-expression matrices with mtDNA mutation data and
2. Illustrate the increase of mitochondrial mutation load with age.

And `mitochondrialLoadAndDEG.ipynb` for how to
1. Combine Gene-expression matrices with mtDNA mutation data,
2. Identify differentially expressed genes, and
3. Illustrate them as a Volcano plot.
