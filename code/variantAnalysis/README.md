The Pyhton notebook `./variant_analysis.ipynb` allows the reproduction of the results for the full-length human pancreas data set, for which we provide a precomputed gene-expression matrix and mtDNA mutations.

Specifically you may compute
- Comparison of cryptic mutations with with pseudo-bulk heteroplasmy
- Computation of site-frequency spectrum
- Selection effects
- Increasing homoplasmies with age
- Increasing difference between SFS with increasing age difference of donors
